# Noob Quickshell config
This is an attempt to make a Quickshell configuration that suits me, with some fun features.

I will most likely leave it half way done because thing is difficult to make, but it's fun anyway o7.

The verticalBar folder has, surprise, a vertical bar configuration that I dropped due to not see them useful for day to day use, but I want to try and make something after I am happy with the horizontal bar config.
